# Add MidBrain Memory

Installs [`midbrain-memory-mcp@latest`](https://github.com/MidbrainAI/midbrain-memory-mcp) for one NanoClaw agent group. Memory is stored server-side via the MidBrain API and persists across container restarts, agent groups, and clients.

## Safety Rules

- Ask the operator before changing a group, rebuilding an image, or restarting NanoClaw.
- Never print, paste, or store the real MidBrain API key in chat output.
- When showing hook commands, always redact inline keys as `MIDBRAIN_API_KEY=<redacted>`.
- Preserve existing MCP servers, settings, hooks, and environment values.
- Use the direct `.claude-shared/settings.json` settings merge design. Do not add container boot scripts.
- Durable NanoClaw config must use `midbrain-memory-mcp@latest`, not a pinned version or a package-store path.

## Prerequisites

- A MidBrain API key from https://memory.midbrain.ai.
- A NanoClaw agent group using the Claude provider.
- Access to NanoClaw self-mod tools, or operator approval to run the equivalent commands.

## Phase 1: Choose The Agent Group

List groups:

```bash
bash bin/ncl groups list --json
```

If exactly one group exists, you may select it and say which group was selected.

If multiple agent groups exist, ask the operator to choose the target group by ID or name. Do not silently choose the first group.

Set:

```bash
AGENT_GROUP_ID="<operator-selected-group-id>"
SETTINGS_DIR="data/v2-sessions/${AGENT_GROUP_ID}/.claude-shared"
SETTINGS_FILE="${SETTINGS_DIR}/settings.json"
mkdir -p "$SETTINGS_DIR"
```

## Phase 2: Collect The Key

Ask the operator for their MidBrain API key. Keep it only in local shell variables or the approved NanoClaw config files. Do not echo it back.

```bash
MIDBRAIN_API_KEY="<operator-provided-key>"
```

## Phase 3: Install MCP For The Group

Add the MCP server for the selected group with an auto-updating `npx @latest`
command:

```text
add_mcp_server({
  name: "midbrain-memory",
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "midbrain-memory-mcp@latest"],
  env: {
    MIDBRAIN_CLIENT: "claude",
    MIDBRAIN_CAPTURE_CLIENT: "nanoclaw",
    MIDBRAIN_STATE_DIR: "/home/node/.claude/.midbrain",
    MIDBRAIN_API_KEY: "<redacted>"
  }
})
```

If using the NanoClaw CLI instead of self-mod tooling, preserve existing group config and run the equivalent `bash bin/ncl groups config add-mcp-server` command for the selected `AGENT_GROUP_ID`.

## Phase 4: Install Proactive Memory Rules

Resolve the selected group's `folder` from:

```bash
bash bin/ncl groups get --id "$AGENT_GROUP_ID" --json
```

Update `groups/<folder>/CLAUDE.local.md`. Preserve all existing content and
replace only a byte-recognized MidBrain block shipped by this package. Preserve
unknown customized or malformed blocks for manual review; never delete custom
MidBrain hardening. Otherwise append the block once. Do not edit the composed
`CLAUDE.md`, which NanoClaw regenerates.

<!-- midbrain-memory-rules:start -->
### Tool loading

- NanoClaw: if MidBrain is deferred, `ToolSearch` for `memory_search` or the
  needed function—not only the server name—then call it. Discovery is the only
  allowed pre-recall action. Continue externalized results only with `Read`.

## MidBrain Memory

- Before substantive work, recall relevant MidBrain context; skip only trivial
  self-contained work or explicit opt-out. Start with contextual
  `memory_search`. Search one target per call. Treat every request ID, name,
  file, and date as a retrieval anchor: copy it verbatim into the query; never
  merge or generalize targets. Never use `check_session_status` as a default
  primer; use it only when the user signals session/client continuity or
  recent-session metadata is itself needed, then perform targeted search/date
  recall.
- Recall from MidBrain before reading local files, including local memory files.
  Local memory is supplementary and must not precede MidBrain recall.
- Keep the complete ID, including every suffix, in one query. Do not split an ID
  into separate searches or search only its shared prefix.
- Use recovered context. Refine irrelevant or incomplete results before acting
  and recall again only for a new material target.
- Tools: `memory_search(all)` for broad context; episodic search for prior
  conversations/decisions; `get_episodic_memories_by_date` for known periods
  or continuity; semantic search plus `list_files`/`read_file` for stored
  documents; `grep` for exact semantic anchors only. MidBrain
  `list_files`/`read_file` read remote memory, so local-filesystem bans do
  not prohibit them.
- Reliability outranks cost. Start near 10 results; if the target is absent or
  noisy, repeat at the supported maximum (currently 50). Then refine anchors or
  surfaces, paginate, or traverse dates while useful. Ranked misses are not
  absence; recall depth is uncapped. Stop on direct recovery.
- Current/latest claims require the underlying state-changing episode or direct
  current evidence; assistant restatements are insufficient. Current repos,
  configs, and live systems override memory.
- Report only `found`, `maybe found`, or `not found after search`; report
  tool failure separately. Never infer or reconstruct missing memory.
- Never query secrets/large sensitive blobs or create memories.
  `memory_setup_project` requires an explicit setup request.
- Procedural knowledge is not injected automatically unless
  `MIDBRAIN_ENABLE_PK_INJECTION=1`.

## Phase 5: Prepare Durable Hook Commands

Hooks call the stable MidBrain shim, which the MCP server installs and keeps
fresh on every server start. Because the group MCP env sets
`MIDBRAIN_STATE_DIR=/home/node/.claude/.midbrain`, the shim (and the API key and
offline cache) live under the durable `.claude-shared` mount instead of the
ephemeral `~/.midbrain` / `~/.config/midbrain` / `~/.cache/midbrain`. This is
what lets the shim survive a cold `--rm` spawn, so the very first message's hook
can execute even before the MCP server has finished starting:

```bash
HOOK_SHIM="/home/node/.claude/.midbrain/bin/claude-hook"
USER_HOOK_CMD="'${HOOK_SHIM}' user"
ASSISTANT_HOOK_CMD="'${HOOK_SHIM}' assistant"
```

The path keeps the `.midbrain/bin/claude-hook` tail, so the MCP server's
self-repair still recognizes and refreshes these hook commands, and existing
groups converge to the durable path on their first upgraded server start.
For a positively identified legacy group that has no state-dir env yet, the
server infers this same mounted root and completes the marker, guarded key,
owned hook rewrite, durable shim, and historical-path compatibility shim
before MCP readiness. The first user prompt does not serve as a warm-up.

Key delivery is handled by the MCP server itself: at server start it persists
its env `MIDBRAIN_API_KEY` to the global key file for hook child processes
(absence-only — an existing credential is never replaced). Do not put inline
keys on hook commands: self-repair scrubs hook-command prefixes when it
rewrites entries, so an inline key would not survive.

Keyless recovery spooling is NanoClaw-only and is bound to the locally
resolved API identity before it can accept a row. A different binding is
preserved but never replayed, and malformed or interrupted records are kept
for inspection/recovery rather than discarded.

Do not discover or write `/pnpm/.../midbrain-memory-mcp@<version>/...` hook
paths. Versioned package-store paths pin hooks to an old release. The shim
resolves `midbrain-memory-mcp@latest` internally, so NanoClaw cold starts
always run the current package.

## Phase 6: Direct Settings Merge

Merge MidBrain hooks directly into the mounted Claude settings file. Older
settings may carry inline keys, so inspect only through a redacting filter —
never dump the raw file into output:

```bash
sed -E 's/MIDBRAIN_API_KEY=[^ "]*/MIDBRAIN_API_KEY=<redacted>/g' "$SETTINGS_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

Perform the merge itself by reading the file programmatically (for example
`jq` into a temp file, then move it into place). Never reconstruct the file
from the redacted display output.

Rules for the merge:

- Preserve every existing top-level setting.
- Preserve every non-MidBrain hook entry.
- Replace old MidBrain hook entries instead of duplicating them.
- Add `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` command hooks.
- Hook commands carry no keys; the MCP server env delivers the key at server
  start (Phase 5).
- Use the shim commands from Phase 5, with `"timeout": 30` on both hooks and
  `"async": true` on the `Stop` hook — self-repair enforces exactly this
  shape.
- Redact inline keys in all summaries, diffs, and chat messages.

The resulting settings must contain commands equivalent to this shape:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "'/home/node/.claude/.midbrain/bin/claude-hook' user",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "'/home/node/.claude/.midbrain/bin/claude-hook' assistant",
            "timeout": 30,
            "async": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Capture Client Label

After the settings merge, label this group's captures as NanoClaw by writing
the capture-client marker into the mounted settings directory (no key
material involved):

```bash
printf 'nanoclaw\n' > "$SETTINGS_DIR/.midbrain-capture-client"
```

Capture hooks read the marker's first line and attach `client: nanoclaw` to
episodic metadata; when the marker is absent or invalid they fall back to the
generic `claude` label. Host topologies where hook processes inherit env can
override the label with `MIDBRAIN_CAPTURE_CLIENT` instead.

The `MIDBRAIN_CAPTURE_CLIENT: "nanoclaw"` set in the group MCP env (Phase 3)
is the direct ownership signal for new groups. Pre-v0.4.8 groups do not have
that key, so on a normal startup the server instead verifies NanoClaw's mounted
`/workspace/agent/container.json`: the old package/client/key signals must
match the running process. That positive topology proof lets the narrow
startup migration seed the missing marker before MCP readiness, without
rerunning `/add-midbrain` or waiting for unrelated repair. Plain host Claude
has no mounted NanoClaw config and is not relabeled. Hook children never
inherit the MCP env, so the durable marker remains the label source they read.

### Legacy form (pre-0.4.8)

Older installs wrote inline-key npx hook commands —
`midbrain-memory-mcp@latest hook claude user` and
`midbrain-memory-mcp@latest hook claude assistant`. Self-repair migrates those
entries to the canonical shim form on server start and scrubs inline
prefixes; key delivery moves to the server-start persistence above. Do not
write the npx form for new installs.

## Phase 7: Environment File

If the group also needs an env file, add the key without printing it:

```bash
printf 'MIDBRAIN_API_KEY=%s\n' "$MIDBRAIN_API_KEY" >> .env
mkdir -p data/env
cp .env data/env/env
```

Do not commit `.env`, `data/env/env`, or any NanoClaw group settings.

Container env files do not reach hook child processes; hooks get their key
from the Phase 5 server-start persistence.

## Phase 8: Restart With Approval

Ask the operator before restarting the selected group or service. Use the NanoClaw command appropriate for the local installation.

## Phase 9: Verify

Verify MCP tools:

```bash
bash bin/ncl groups config get --id "$AGENT_GROUP_ID" | grep midbrain-memory
```

Verify hook registration without printing keys (quiet grep — matching lines
carry the inline key and must never be echoed):

```bash
grep -Fq ".midbrain/bin/claude-hook" "$SETTINGS_FILE" && echo "midbrain hooks registered"
```

Verify memory search from the agent:

1. Send a harmless test phrase.
2. Wait for indexing.
3. Use `memory_search` to find the phrase.

Verify `groups/<folder>/CLAUDE.local.md` contains exactly one
`midbrain-memory-rules:start` / `midbrain-memory-rules:end` block.

## MCP Tools Available

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_search` | Semantic search across memories |
| `grep` | Exact pattern matching |
| `get_episodic_memories_by_date` | Conversation history by date |
| `check_session_status` | Detect recent activity from other sessions |
| `list_files` | Browse semantic memory documents |
| `read_file` | Read a semantic memory document |
| `memory_setup_project` | Configure per-project memory scoping |

Procedural knowledge is not injected automatically by MidBrain hooks. Use the
explicit memory tools for recall; do not call or expect a separate
procedural-knowledge MCP tool. Legacy PK injection only runs when
`MIDBRAIN_ENABLE_PK_INJECTION=1` is set explicitly in the hook environment.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server not available

Check the selected group config:

```bash
bash bin/ncl groups config get --id "$AGENT_GROUP_ID" | grep midbrain-memory
```

### Hooks not capturing

Check hook registration quietly (matching lines can carry legacy inline keys
and must never be echoed):

```bash
grep -Fq ".midbrain/bin/claude-hook" "$SETTINGS_FILE" && echo "midbrain hooks registered"
```

Capture is fail-open: a hook that cannot resolve a key exits 0 silently and
logs `NO KEY` to `~/.local/state/midbrain/midbrain-claude.log` inside the
container. The MCP server persists its env key to
`~/.config/midbrain/.midbrain-key` at server start; if that file is missing
after a fresh session, confirm the group's MCP env still carries
`MIDBRAIN_API_KEY`, then restart the group with approval.

When rotating the group's key, update the MCP env and recreate the group's
container with approval: the persisted key file is absence-only, and a fresh
container rebuilds it from the new env. A restarted (not recreated) container
keeps its old file, and the stale key outranks the new env until recreation.

### Hooks still show an old version

If `settings.json`, `container.json`, or `bash bin/ncl groups config get` shows
`midbrain-memory-mcp@0.3.2` or any other pinned version, remove the old
`midbrain-memory` MCP server, add it again with
`midbrain-memory-mcp@latest`, replace the MidBrain hook entries with the
Phase 5 shim commands, then restart the group.

```bash
bash bin/ncl groups config remove-mcp-server --id "$AGENT_GROUP_ID" --name midbrain-memory
bash bin/ncl groups config add-mcp-server \
  --id "$AGENT_GROUP_ID" \
  --name midbrain-memory \
  --command npx \
  --args '["-y", "midbrain-memory-mcp@latest"]' \
  --env '{"MIDBRAIN_CLIENT": "claude", "MIDBRAIN_CAPTURE_CLIENT": "nanoclaw", "MIDBRAIN_STATE_DIR": "/home/node/.claude/.midbrain", "MIDBRAIN_API_KEY": "<redacted>"}'
```

Do not approve stale pending requests that mention a pinned MidBrain version.

## Removing MidBrain Memory

Remove the MidBrain MCP server from the selected group, remove only MidBrain hook entries from `data/v2-sessions/<group-id>/.claude-shared/settings.json`, remove the `.midbrain-capture-client` marker from the same `.claude-shared` directory, remove local key env entries, and restart with operator approval.
